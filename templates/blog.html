<!--One of the first and easiest changes is to make the header 
for the blog title on the home page be a link. But what url do 
we want it to link to? Well, this is the format that we want the 
url of a single blog entry to have: ./blog?id=6 (Here 6 is just 
one example of an id number for a blog post.) So using jinja2 
templating syntax, how can you make sure that each blog entry 
that is generated on the main page has an href with a query
parameter corresponding to its id?-->

            <form method="POST" action="/blog">
                <input type="hidden" name="blog-id" id = "blog-id" value="{{blog.id}}">
                <a href='/blog?id={{blog.id}}'>
                <h2>{{blog.title}}</h2></a>
                </input>
            </form>
            {{blog.body}}
            {{blog.id}} <!--For testing, remove later-->
